                  The project was executed at our College campus with a group of young, enthusiast and
                  dynamic team of college students. The goal of the project was to develop a software tool
                  for Network Administration, which can be done remotely.
                  My contribution to the team was to gather requirements by conducting meeting with our
                  college’s Network Administrator and come up with a list of items, which could facilitate
                  him to manage network resources efficiently. With this we came up with a requirements
                  specification and started working on the design.
                  We then did research of which technology to be used and decided upon Java. I wrote Java
                  programs using Java’s RMI technology.

                <p>The project was only used for query based, domain specific text documents and
                  not for web pages (web mining).</p>
                <p>Dimensionality reduction techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
                  and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were used to produce reduced dataset.</p>
                <p>Genetic Algorithm is one of the powerful searching mechanism known for its
                  robustness and quick search capabilities. So, it was used for with Fitness
                  Functions for fast and effective information retrieval.</p>
